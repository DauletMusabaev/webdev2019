<p><strong>Hawaii's</strong> diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists.<br> 
Because of its central location in the <em>Pacific</em> and 19th-century labor migration, Hawaii's culture is strongly influenced by North American and East Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian culture.<br> </p>
        
<p><strong>Hawaii</strong> has over a million permanent residents, along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel. Its capital is Honolulu on the island of O?ahu.</p>
